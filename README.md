# optimization

This repo provides a set of tutorials demonstrating different optimization problems and computational techniques to solve them.

## Getting Started

### Get the package

```
# Navigate to your local folder
cd /your/local/folder

# Clone the WindML repository
git clone git@github.com:marcodigennaro/optimization.git

# Enter the folder
cd optimization/

# Create the python environment from the pyproject.toml file
poetry install

# Activate the python environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests 
poetry run pytest -v

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter-lab  
```

### Content of the Jupyter Notebooks

  1. bus_allocation.ipynb presents a simple linear optimization problem and two main, non-trivial solutions. 
One is an educated guess coming from a common-sense hypothesis, the second one involve a simple linear optimization.
Both are compared to the real solution in terms of precision, memory and time required.
